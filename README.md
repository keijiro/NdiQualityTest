This is a small program that tests the alpha channel image quality of the [NDI] video codec.

- Left half: Errors in a simple gradient pattern
- Right half: Errors in a noise pattern

I wanted to check if it can be used to store depth values in volumetric videos. My conclusion is that it doesn't work.
